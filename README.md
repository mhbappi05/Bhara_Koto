# ভাড়া কত? - Bus Fare and Route Finder

**ভাড়া কত?** (What's the fare?) is a dedicated bus fare and route finder application designed to assist commuters in Bangladesh. Our mission is to make public transportation more predictable and accessible by providing a fast and reliable tool to check bus fares and find the best routes.

## Features

### Accurate Fare Calculation
We provide a quick and precise fare estimate between any two locations in our database, including both standard and student fares.

### Intelligent Route Planning
The app helps you find the most convenient way to travel. It shows you direct bus routes and, if a direct option isn't available, it suggests two-bus transfer routes, detailing the exact stop where you need to change buses.

### Intuitive and Localized Design
The app's interface is clean and easy to use. It supports both Bengali and English, ensuring it's accessible to a broad audience. Our responsive design ensures a smooth experience whether you're on a desktop or a mobile phone.

### Community-Powered Data
We are committed to keeping our data up-to-date. If you find any missing fare information, our integrated WhatsApp link allows you to report it directly to our team, helping us improve the service for everyone.
